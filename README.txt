These repository is being created as the SPE book "Pressure Transient Testing" is 
rereaded. The "example.py" files are book exercises and the "project_1.py" file is 
a simple simulator used for matching a pressure test (varying some parameters), 
which uses superposition in time and space.

The main file is "CDY.py" (named after Dynamic Reservoir Characterization acronym
in spanish). Here all the functions are added as required by every the other file, 
so now it is quite limited. Soon there will be added features for Gas and Naturally 
Fractured Reservoirs.
